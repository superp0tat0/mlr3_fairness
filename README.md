# mlr3_fairness
Hi. My name is Siyi Wei. I am currently a master student studying statistics at University of Toronto. My interests are about Data Science and Machine Learning. I would love to explore more about Data Fairness. So I am thinking whether I could contribute to mlr3-fairness this summer. I have a pretty strong CS background and a lot of experience of R. I have attached my linkedin here https://www.linkedin.com/in/siyi-wei/

# The project demo
For the project demo. I have finished the easy part but I am not sure about the medium part. Since I am not familiar about data fairness before. I may need some further guidance to what do you want me to show, some resources would be better. I have investigated the prediction bias on gender and race for COMPAS dataset. I have also explored the PCA transformed data fairness compare with the original data fairness on MNIST in the project. Please let me know what else I need to do. I will further work on the Issues about mlr3 package.
